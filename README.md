# Secure-Engineering-Support-Tool
The ESA GSTP SEST tool is intended to first support the space systems development challenges encountered by the European Space Agency (ESA) programs, where cyber-security is already an established concern.  The SEST tool will help bridging the gap between system and software engineering processes and equivalent security processes that exist today within ESA.
