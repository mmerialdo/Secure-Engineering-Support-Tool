11E02-02|"Is the authentication protocol used for administrators or holders of special rights considered to be secure?
An authentication protocol is considered secure if it is not susceptible to being broken by a listening device on the network or rendered inoperable by specialists tools (in particular password crack tools). Such security usually uses cryptographic methods."|4||4|E2|6.1.2||
11E02-03|"Are the rules, for instance in the case of passwords, considered to be very strict?
