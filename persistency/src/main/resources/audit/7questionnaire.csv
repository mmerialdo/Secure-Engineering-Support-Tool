07A|Control of access to systems |||||||
07A01|Management of access profiles (rights and privileges granted by functional profile) |||||||
07A01-01|Has a management policy for access rights to the systems been established, built from an analysis of the security requirements based on the business stakes?|2|||E1|9.1.1|11.1.1|
07A01-02|"Is access to the various parts of the information system (applications, data bases, systems, equipments, etc) defined in terms of job profiles which regroup roles or functions within the organization (profiles define access rights which are available to holders of the profile)?
Note: in certain circumstances the notion of ""profile"" may be replaced by the notion of ""group""."|4|2||E1|9.2.3; 9.2.5; 9.4.1|11.2.2|
07A01-03|Is it possible to adjust the access rights attributed to a given profile, based on the nature of the connection and equipment used (location, link, network, protocol, encryption, etc) and on the classification of the resources accessed?|4|||E2|||
07A01-04|Do the profiles also allow definition of working time limits (daily hours and periods in the working calendar, weekends, holidays etc.)?|2|||E3|9.4.2|11.5.6|
07A01-05|Have these profiles and the access rights attributed to the different profiles, as a function of context, been approved by the information owners and the Information Security Officer?|4|2||E2|9.4.2|11.5.6|
07A01-06|"Is the process of definition and management of rights attributed to profiles under strict control?
A strict control requires that the list of people able to change rights attributed to profiles be strictly limited and that the implementation of these rights into tables be strictly secure during transmission and storage and that there exists a reinforced access control in order to be able to modify these rights and that any modification of these rights be logged and audited."|4|3||R1|||
07A01-07|Is it possible to review at any time, the complete list of profiles and of the rights attributed to each profile?  |2|2||C1|||

07A02|Management of access authorizations and privileges (granting, delegation, revocation)|||||||
07A02-01|Does the procedure of granting access authorization require the formal approval of line management (at a sufficiently high level)?|4|2||E1|9.2.2||
07A02-02|Are authorizations granted to named individuals only as a function of their profile?|2|||E1|9.2.2||
07A02-03|"Is the procedure for granting (or changing or revoking) authorization to an individual (either directly or via his profile) strictly controlled?
A strict control requires a formal recognition of the signature (electronic or otherwise) of the requester, that the implementation of the profile attributed to users in the form of tables is highly secure during transmission and storage and that there be a reinforced access control over the modification of such records and that any modification of records be logged and audited."|4|2|3|E2|9.2.2; 9.2.5|11.2.2|
07A02-04|Is there a systematic process of updating the table of access authorizations at the time of departure of personnel (either internal or external)?|4|3||E2|9.2.2; 9.2.5|11.2.4|
07A02-05|Is there a systematic process of updating the table of access authorizations at the time of change of function?|4|||E3|9.2.2; 9.2.5|11.2.4|
07A02-06|"Is there a strictly controlled process (as above) which allows to delegate his/her own authorizations, in part or in whole, to a person of choice for a determined period (in case of absence)?
In this case, the delegated rights must no longer be authorized to the person who has delegated them during this time. The owner however, must have the possibility of taking them back, by which process he or she effectively ends the delegation."|4|||E3|9.2.2||
07A02-07|Is it possible to control at any time, for all users, the rights, authorizations and privileges in force?|2|||C1|9.2.2||
07A02-08|Is there a regular audit, at least once a year, of  the profiles and authorizations granted to all users and of the procedures for management of attributed profiles?|1|2||C1|9.2.5|11.2.4|
07A03|Authentication of the access requester (user or entity)|||||||
07A03-01|Does the process of distribution or modification of the user credentials guarantee that only the holder of the identifier can have access to them (initial communication is confidential, password change is under the exclusive control of the user, etc.)?  |2|1||E1|9.2.4; 9.4.3|11.5.3|
07A03-02|"Does the process of definition or modification of user credentials respect a set of rules which ensures their intrinsic validity?
In the case of passwords: sufficient length (8 characters or more), obligatory mixture of types of characters, frequent change (less than once a month), impossibility of reusing an old password, non-trivial word test using a dictionary, banning of ""standard systems"", first names, anagrams of user name, dates etc. In the case of certificates and authentications based on cryptographic mechanisms: generation process evaluated or publicly recognized, keys of a sufficient length etc."|4|2||E2|9.2.4; 9.4.3|11.2.3; 11.5.3|
07A03-03|"Does the process of presenting a user password guarantee its trustworthiness?
The usage of a password will always be a weak point. The only process which does not divulge observable information consists of either introducing an object containing a secret (smart card), or entering a code which changes at every moment (token card type SecureId) or using a biometric characteristic."|4|2||E3|9.2.4; 9.4.2;  9.4.3|11.5.1; 11.5.3|
07A03-04|"Is the logon process secured?
A secure logon should not give any information before the process is satisfactorily executed, not display the authenticators' password, display date and time of last connection, display eventual connection attempts that have failed, etc. "|1|||E3|9.2.4; 9.4.2;  9.4.3|11.5.1; 11.5.3|
07A03-05|"Do the mechanisms for retention and usage of credentials by the user (or by the equipment representing the user) or by the target systems guarantee trustworthiness and authenticity of these credentials?
Passwords must be stored encrypted and a preliminary access control must be made before being accessible to the user.
In the case of authentication using cryptographic procedures, the mechanism must propose solid guarantees validated by a recognized organization."|2|2|3|E2|9.2.4; 9.4.2;  9.4.3|11.5.1; 11.5.3|
07A03-06|"Do the mechanisms used for the transmission of the credentials between the user and target equipments guarantee trustworthiness and authenticity of these credentials?
Transmission of a password must be encrypted or use an algorithm which introduces a variable at each transmission.
In the case of authentication using cryptographic procedures, the mechanism must propose solid guarantees validated by a recognized organization."|2|2|3|E3|9.4.2;  9.4.3|11.5.1; 11.5.3|
07A03-07|In the case of multiple incorrect authentication attempts, is there an automatic process which temporarily invalidates the identifier used or, possibly, the user workstation itself, or which slows down the authentication process so as to inhibit any automatic routine from connecting?|4|2||E2|9.4.2;  9.4.3|11.5.1; 11.5.3|

07A03-10|"Are authentication parameters under strict control?
A strict control requires that the list of people allowed to change the definition rules of credentials, the credentials themselves, the rules of surveillance of connection attempts etc., be strictly limited and that there exists a reinforced access control to effect these modifications, that these modifications be logged and audited and that there exists a regular general audit at least once a year of all authentication parameters."|4|2||R1|||
07A03-11|"Are the processes that ensure authentication under strict control?
A strict control requires that the software used has been validated and undergoes a regular test for integrity (close with a seal) and that there be an audit at least once a year of authentication procedures and processes (including the processes which aim to detect intrusion attempts and the processes which respond to these intrusion attempts)."|4|3||C1|||
07A04|Access filtering and management of associations |||||||
07A04-01|Does any access to a system require the use of an identifier recognized by the system?|1|2||E1||11.5.2|
07A04-02|"Is there a direct or indirect correspondence between any identifier and a real physical person?
In the case where an application calls another or executes a system call, it may be that the application does not transfer to the target system the identifier which originally made the request. The link between the call, the identifier and the user himself must remain traceable after the fact."|4|2||E1||11.5.2|
07A04-03|Have all generic or by-default accounts been deleted?|4|2||E2||11.5.2|
07A04-04|"Is the acceptance of the identifier by the system systematically subject to authentication?
Systematic authentication requires that the process be implemented for all subsystems (Remote process monitors, database management systems, batch processes, etc.), for all application requests and for all access routes, including ports reserved for remote maintenance."|2|2||E2|9.4.2|11.5.2|

07A04-07|Is there a systematic control, based upon definite access rules, of the profile of the requester, of the association context and of the appropriateness of that profile and context for the access requested?|4|2||E3|||
07A04-08|"Are the parameters for the definition and management of access filtering rules under strict control?
A strict control requires that the list of persons allowed to change the security parameters for access filtering be extremely limited, and that there be a reinforced access control in order to be able to effect such modification and that any modification be logged and audited."|4|2||R1|||
07A04-09|"Are the processes that guarantee access filtering under strict control?
A strict control requires that the software used has been validated and undergoes a regular test for integrity (close with a seal) and that there be an audit at least once a year of access filtering procedures and processes (including the processes which aim to detect intrusion attempts and the processes which respond to these intrusion attempts)."|4|3||C1|||

07A05-03|"Does the authentication mechanism of the accessed servers provide a recognized ""strong"" level of security?
Notably the usage of a simple password will always be a weakness. The only methods recognized as ""strong"", that is observable without divulging information, are those based on cryptographic algorithms."|4|2||E3|||
07A05-04|"Do the security equipment that retain credentials (e.g. passwords, calling number, etc.) use mechanisms which guarantee their impregnability and authenticity?
Passwords must be stored encrypted and a preliminary control of the user must be made before usage.

Transmission of a password must be encrypted or use an algorithm which introduces a variable at each transmission. 
In the case of authentication using cryptographic procedures, the mechanism must provide solid guarantees validated by a recognized organization."|4|3||E3|||
07A05-06|Does the revoked keys management procedure guarantee that the control systems take into consideration in real time any revocation of keys?|4|2||E2|||
07A05-07|Does the revoked keys management procedure guarantee that the control systems systematically test that the keys used have not been revoked?|4|2||E3|||
07A05-08|"Are the processes that guarantee the authentication of the accessed entities under strict control?
A strict control requires that the software used has been validated and undergoes a regular test for integrity (seal) and that there is an audit at least once a year of the authentication procedures and processes."|4|3||R1|||
