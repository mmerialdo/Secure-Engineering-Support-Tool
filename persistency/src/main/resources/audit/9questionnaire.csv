In the case where an application calls another one or calls a system, it may be that the application does not transfer to the target system the identifier which originally made the request. However, the link between that call and the original user identifier must remain traceable after the fact."|4|2||E1|9.4.1|11.5.2; 11.6.1|

09A05-03|"Does the authentication mechanism of the accessed sensitive applications provide a recognized ""strong"" level of security?
